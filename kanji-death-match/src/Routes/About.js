            <p>This app is Adrian's second project for the General Assembly
                 Software Engineering Immersive program. Kanji Deathmatch is the
                 marraige of two of Adrian's favorite things: language acquisition, and
                 sensless violence. It was created using the 
                 React javascript framework.</p>
