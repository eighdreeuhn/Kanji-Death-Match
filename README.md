# Kanji-Death-Match

## GA-SEI Project-2

### Project Overview
The project marries two of my favorite things into one App: language aquisition, and mindless games. I've long been fascinated by the Japanese language. I want my app to take the user's input, return the corresponding kanji as the user's character, and then have that kanji fight another kanji to the death. Attacks are calculated based on level, stroke-count and an rng.

### Project Description
This project has two major elements: getting user input, fetching the correct kanji from the API, and displaying all of the relevant detailed information from a second API call for information when clicked/selected. The second major piece is the fight sequence, which will be either a series of user clicks to advance the action, or a set-Interval quto-play. I'm unsure which it will be at this point, but the basic flow is the same for both.

### API
I'm  using Kanji Alive! The API has three search endpoints, a basic, an advanced, and a details, so it was necessary to make two fetch calls to get the detailed info on each kanji. This created an interesting problem with rendering that was ultimately solved by wrapping the second fetch in a Promise.all() and mapping through the array of kanji returned by the first fetch.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
