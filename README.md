# Kanji-Death-Match
GA-SEI Project-2

# Project Overview

The project marries two of my favorite things into one App: language aquisition, and mindless games. I've long been fascinated by the Japanese language. I want my app to take the user's input, return the corresponding kanji as the user's character, and then have that kanji fight another kanji to the death. Attacks are calculated based on level, stroke-count and an rng.

## Project Description

This project has two major elements: getting user input, fetching the correct kanji from the API, and displaying all of the relevant detailed information from a second API call for information when clicked/selected.
The second major piece is the fight sequence, which will be either a series of user clicks to advance the action, or a set-Interval quto-play. I'm unsure which it will be at this point, but the basic flow is the same for both.

## API

I've found a few APIs that fit the bill here. I'm currently using Kanji Alive!
